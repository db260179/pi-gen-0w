# Setup the Internet clock sync.

# Because you uninstalled fake-hwclock (it wonâ€™t be able to store clock on a
# readonly filesystem), you need to install and set up NTP sync. Also clock
# keeping is poor on a standard RPi so you may consider updating time regularly
# (every hour or two should be enough).
